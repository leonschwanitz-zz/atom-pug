Contributions
---------
This plugin was originally created by [merrihew](https://github.com/merrihew/atom-jade). But since Jade became Pug I have changed the name and published it to atom.


The grammars used in this project were written by the original author of the jade-tmbundle.
**feel free to open a pull request** to help improve the package.
